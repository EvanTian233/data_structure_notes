669. Trim a Binary Search Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/trim-a-binary-search-tree/

Given the root of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as low and high, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in [low, high]. Trimming the tree should not change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). It can be proven that there is a unique answer.

Return the root of the trimmed binary search tree. Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,0,2], low = 1, high = 2
Output: [1,null,2]
